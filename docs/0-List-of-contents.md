# HiGP Users Manual

Gaussian processes (GPs) are a set of flexible, non-parametric Bayesian methods for modeling complex data. HiGP is a high-performance Python package for GP regression (GPR) and GP classification (GPC). This HiGP user manual contains four parts:

1. Basic usage of HiGP
    * 1.1 Install HiGP
    * 1.2 A simple example with the "EZ" interface
2. Advanced usage of HiGP
    * 2.1 Mathematical definitions
    * 2.2 Kernels
    * 2.3 Data structures
    * 2.4 Defining and training a GP model
    * 2.5 Make predictions
    * 2.6 Defining and using a custom kernel
3. API reference
4. Compiling
    * 4.1 Structure of HiGP
    * 4.2 Building HiGP on local machine
    * 4.3 Travis CI
    * 4.4 Building the Python packages for release
    * 4.5 Debugging the C/C++ source code on local machine
